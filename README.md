The following code repo works around the principle of flood mapping and was built for the final year B.Tech project. The Project was completed under the guidance of Dr. G. S Baghel, Asst. Prof. Dept. of NIT Silchar

# Running the Code

Go to Google Earth Engine, add the code from the code file. 

The top 4 lines with data set will appear as yellow, click on convert on right and it will be loaded as data. Finally just click on run at top side and visualize the results on the bottom.
